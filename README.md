# Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures Assignment
This project implements two key components related to algorithms and data structures;
# Part 1 - Selection Algorithms
Implementation of the deterministic Median of Medians algorithm and the Randomized Quickselect algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an array.
* Deterministic Algorithm (Median of Medians) - This algorithm selects the kth smallest element in worst-case linear time O(n) by partitioning the array into groups, finding medians, and using the median of medians as the pivot.
# Part 2 - Elementary Data Structures 
Implementation of Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists with their fundamental operations in Python.
* Randomized Algorithm (Quickselect) - This algorithm selects the kth smallest element in expected linear time O(n) by randomly selecting a pivot and partitioning the array.
 # How to run the python scripts
* Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
* Save the Python script
* Run the script from the terminal or command prompt
# Summary of Findings
* Selection Algorithms - Both the deterministic and randomized algorithms were implemented successfully. The Median of Medians guarantees linear time complexity in the worst case, whereas Randomized Quickselect is faster on average but may degrade to O(n2) in rare cases.
* Data Structures - Stacks and queues implemented with arrays and singly linked lists demonstrate the core principles of data manipulation in common applications. Their operations function with expected time complexities.
